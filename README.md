# Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling
This project is an interactive data acoustic modelling program created in order to tackle the problem of
excessive reverberations in businesses or schools that could be harmful to work and learning environments.
This project takes an audio sample, and presents to the user 6 graphs(waveform, rt60 low, mid, high).
The architecture of this program is in a Model-View-Controller format.
